I'm a first-year PhD student from Chang'an University, Department of Transportation Engineering. I gratuated from Fuzhou University with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Then, I pursued my master's degree in Transportation Engineering at Chang'an University, and fortunately, I was granted the opportunity to continue directly into a PhD program during my second year of graduate studies and studied under Dr.Xing Fu,who is a excellent teacher.


My research direction are post-disaster road network repair and scheduling，improving resilience of post-disaster road network repair.
